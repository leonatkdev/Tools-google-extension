DevKit is a power  ful, multi-functional tool designed to streamline the workflow of both developers and designers. This extension provides a variety of essential utilities aimed at improving productivity and efficiency in design and development projects. With a focus on ease of use and versatility, the toolkit brings together tools like a color picker, lorem ipsum generator, typography analyzer, and image resizer/converter in one convenient interface.

## Features:
### Color Picker:

A comprehensive tool for selecting and managing colors. Easily pick colors from any web page or image, view them in different formats (HEX, RGBA, HSL), and fine-tune transparency with an alpha slider. The color picker includes features for adding favorite colors and tracking recent selections. You can also copy colors directly to the clipboard in your preferred format.
Upcoming Improvement: The color picker will be fully optimized in the next release, with enhancements to color accuracy and performance, particularly when dealing with colors that include alpha transparency. Bug fixes related to color rendering on the canvas will also be addressed.
Lorem Ipsum Generator:

### Lorem ipsum generator:

Quickly generate placeholder text for your designs or content mockups. Choose from generating paragraphs, words, bytes, or even lists. The generated text can be customized to include links, ideal for testing layout structures and content distribution.
Typography Analyzer:

### Typography checker:

Analyze and inspect the typography used on a web page or within a design. This tool allows you to check font properties like family, size, weight, line height, and color. Easily copy the entire set of CSS properties to your clipboard for fast integration into your codebase.
Image Resizer & Converter:

### Image resizer/converter

Resize and convert images to different formats with ease. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, WebP, and SVG. The resizer maintains aspect ratio integrity and allows for zooming and panning for precise control over your image dimensions. Save images with or without transparency, and choose the appropriate format for your projectâ€™s needs.
Future Updates:
We are committed to regularly enhancing the toolkit, adding new features, and fixing any existing bugs to ensure an even smoother experience. Look forward to:

Enhanced color picking accuracy and expanded format support.
Additional tools for design and development, such as contrast checkers, text transformations, and more.
Continuous performance improvements and bug fixes based on user feedback.
Whether you're a developer coding the frontend or a designer working on the perfect color scheme, this extension is designed to be your go-to companion for everyday tasks. It helps you manage essential tasks like choosing the right colors, generating placeholder text, resizing images, and inspecting typographyâ€”all in one place!
